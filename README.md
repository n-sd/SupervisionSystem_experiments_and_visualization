# Short description

This is a collection of Python (Jupyter Notebook) scripts used in order to visualize graph traversal taking place in the course of automatic supervision using the supervision system implemented in Maude. These scripts have been used at various stages in order to debug the supervision system, visualize the course of supervision as well as derive experimental results for the papers. 
This collection contains mainly three files and the supervision system.
The supervision system is contained in the ` graphCookies.maude ` and ` SupervisionSystem.maude ` files. 

# Files

The most recent script is the ` graphTestingScript.ipynb ` , which has been used to derive conformance checking results and supervision results for the most recent version of the supervision system. 
The ` graphTest.ipynb ` script contains the first version of the visualizing script using the ` networkx ` library. 
The ` Checking_Graph_Maude ..  .ipynb ` script contains the early version of the script used for performing conformance checking and collecting experimental results without graphical visualizing. 

# Functionality and Documentation

These scripts were used for exclusively for individual use and therefore are scarcely documented. They contain some main guidlines and examples that can show how they can be used, which is sufficient for individual use, which, however, is not sufficient for use by everyone beyond the exhausitve examples given in these files. 
These files were not designed for long-term use and were only developed for temporary use in order to visually debug the system and derive experimental results used for the publication.
